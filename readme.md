Travel Planner

This was a project created for the first half of my web development boot camp, using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The Travel Planner project allows users to create a to-do list of trips they want to take, as well as document trips they've already taken. I created this app because I love to travel and thought it would be nice to have an app that allows me to plan and document my travels.
